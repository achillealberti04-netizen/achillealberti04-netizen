Management Engineering student currently learning how to apply data and software tools to finance. I have hands-on experience in the Treasury Department at Drillmec S.p.A., where I was introduced to cash flow monitoring, FX exposure, interest rate risk, and KYC compliance.

I am developing skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau to explore financial data, build visualizations, and practice financial modeling. My goal is to connect my interest in finance, macroeconomics, and European institutions with a strong foundation in technology and data-driven analysis.
